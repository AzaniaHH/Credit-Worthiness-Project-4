# Credit Worthiness 

The analysis aimed to determine the probablity of a loan defaulting due to factors collected in the data. The team secured data from Kaggle, cleaned the dataset, built a regression model and created an interactive (HTML) user interface (UI) to get predictions.  The HTML page allowed users to see the predictions of the model. The evaluation had limitations due to limitations within the data. This report outlines the limitations of the data and an overview of the analysis.
